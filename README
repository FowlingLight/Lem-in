Lanch the program using './lem-in < file'

The program will diplay the file used and show the path by moving ants on it. Each node can only contain one ant, so the ouptup will be P1-2, saying that an ant is moving from the node 1 to the node 2

You can create a graph using the following format:
number_of_ants
node1 x y
##start //stating that the following node is the start of the graph
node2 x y
#comment
##end
node3 x y //stating that the following node is the end of the graph
node1-node2 //indicating a connection between these nodes
node2-node3

To put a comment in the file, you need to use #, not //
The // are only used here to add additionnal information
